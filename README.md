This repository contains a graphics project that demonstrates how to draw, scale, and fill a polygon using both OpenGL (C++) and Matplotlib (Python).

The project covers:

1. Drawing a six-sided polygon based on given coordinates.

2. Scaling the polygon by a factor of 2.

3. Filling the original with color and the scaled version with asterisks (*).
